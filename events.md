# Event-Driven Architecture Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for adding an event-driven architecture to our high-performance matching engine. The architecture will leverage Rust's async capabilities while ensuring the core matching logic remains highly performant.

## Performance Requirements
Recent benchmarks show exceptional performance:
- Order addition: ~108 ns
- Order removal: ~5.3 ns
- Get best prices: ~1.3 ns
- Process matching order: ~1.7 Î¼s

**The event system must not compromise these metrics for the core matching operations.**

## Technical Approach

### Core Principles
1. **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Use Rust's zero-cost abstractions to maintain performance while adding event capabilities
2. **Non-Blocking Design**: Ensure core matching operations never block on event handling
3. **Minimize Allocations**: Avoid heap allocations in hot paths
4. **Careful Boundary Design**: Clear separation between sync matching core and async event handling

### Rust Best Practices
1. **Lock-Free Communication**: Use atomic operations and lock-free data structures where possible
2. **RAII Pattern**: Leverage Rust's ownership model for resource management
3. **Const Generics**: Use for compile-time optimizations where applicable
4. **Static Dispatch**: Prefer static dispatch over dynamic dispatch in performance-critical paths
5. **Error Handling**: Use `thiserror` for error types and avoid panicking in production code

### Technology Stack
1. **Tokio**: Selected as our async runtime for its:
   - High-performance single-threaded scheduler for predictable latency
   - Efficient work-stealing scheduler for background tasks
   - Optimized synchronization primitives (`mpsc`, `oneshot`, etc.)
   - CPU pinning capabilities for latency-sensitive threads

2. **Channels Strategy**:
   - **Fast Path**: Use `tokio::sync::mpsc` channels with carefully sized buffers
   - **Fan-Out**: Use `tokio::sync::broadcast` for multi-subscriber events
   - **Backpressure**: Implement configurable backpressure mechanisms

3. **Thread Model**:
   - Dedicated thread for matching engine core (no async)
   - Separate thread pool for event processing (async)
   - Optional CPU affinity for critical threads

### Performance Preservation Techniques
1. **Batching**: Batch events before serialization and persistence
2. **Ring Buffers**: Use pre-allocated ring buffers for high-frequency events
3. **Two-Phase Commit**: For critical operations, use a two-phase commit pattern
4. **Asynchronous Logging**: Ensure logging never blocks the critical path
5. **Benchmarking Harness**: Continuous benchmarking to catch performance regressions

### Clean Code Guidelines
1. **Module Structure**: Clear separation of concerns with well-defined interfaces
2. **Documentation**: Document all public APIs and implementation details for complex algorithms
3. **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling and propagation
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration testing with performance benchmarks
5. **Naming Conventions**: Clear and consistent naming following Rust conventions
